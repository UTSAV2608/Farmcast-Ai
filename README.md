# Farmcast-AI
A Flask-based web application that predicts the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions (e.g., nitrogen, temperature, humidity). It uses a pre-trained machine learning model and displays the predicted crop along with an image. Users can input data through a simple form, and the app provides predictions in real-time.
